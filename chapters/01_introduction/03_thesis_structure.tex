In Chapter~\ref{ch:demand_forecasting}, we introduced the background of demand forecasting, including statistical and machine learning models, forecasting techniques, and multi-step forecasting.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:interpretability_explainability}, we discussed the importance of interpretability and explainability in machine learning models, including the difference between the two concepts, the importance of model transparency, and the different methods to interpret and explain machine learning models.

In Chapter~\ref{sec:feature_importance_estimation}, we discussed the importance of feature importance estimation in machine learning models, the challenges in practice, and the different techniques to estimate feature importance and address these challenges.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:hierarchical_feature_importance}, we discussed the importance of hierarchical feature importance in machine learning models, the construction of hierarchies, and the experiments on hierarchical and grouped data.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:collaborative_development}, we discussed the importance of collaborative development for decision support, the automated delivery of models as services, and the conclusions.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusions}, we discussed the conclusions and future work.
