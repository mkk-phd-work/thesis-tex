% The importance of XAI in demand forecasting isn't just about improving the technology – it’s about improving the human-machine partnership. With XAI, demand planners aren't just passive recipients of AI predictions; they're active participants in the forecasting process.

%\subsection*{Key Takeaways:}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Causal AI is essential when decision-making requires intervention (e.g., "What happens if we change X?")
%\item XAI helps interpret model predictions but may still rely on correlations rather than causation.
%\item In forecasting, using both approaches together can improve decision support—XAI for model transparency, and Causal AI for actionable insights.
%\end{itemize}
