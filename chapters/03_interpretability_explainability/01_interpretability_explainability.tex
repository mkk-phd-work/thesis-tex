Interpretability and explainability are two important concepts in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

%They are essential for understanding the decisions made by machine learning models. Interpretability refers to the ability to explain the model's predictions in a human-understandable way. Explainability, on the other hand, refers to the ability to explain the model's predictions in a way that is understandable to non-experts. In this chapter, we discuss the importance of interpretability and explainability in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and we explore some of the methods used to achieve these goals. We also discuss the challenges of achieving interpretability and explainability in time series forecasting, and we explore the use of feature importance as a basis for model reasoning.
