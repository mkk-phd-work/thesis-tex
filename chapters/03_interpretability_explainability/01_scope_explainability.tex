\subsection{Explainability in forecasting}\label{subsec:explainability-in-forecasting}
The number of publications on forecasting explainability is limited.
\cite{fahse2022explanation} tackled the presentation of explanations for sales forecasting models, but not the explanation methods themselves.
\cite{Saluja_2021} used SHAP values to explain the prediction of a time series model but on local level and not global level.
Skforecast~cite{joachim2023demand} library extracts model specific global feature importance from tree ensemble models.
The work is focused on either global feature importance or local feature contribution without considering the multi-series and hierarchical structure of the data.
