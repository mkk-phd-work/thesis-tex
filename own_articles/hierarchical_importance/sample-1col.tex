        Demand forecasting is a prediction problem that aims to estimate future needs based on historical data.
        It serves as the basis for optimal decision making in multiple areas of value chains such as manufacturing, logistics, and retail.
        It is particularly important in demand forecasting models where demand drivers like price, promotions, and resource planning can help companies optimise pricing, promotional activities, resource planning, and inventory planning.
        Our goal is to identify applicable feature importance techniques to hierarchical forecasting problems by providing insights into feature importance and the underlying decision-making process and helping to understand the model's reasoning.
        We propose applying SHAP values to a forecasting model while using part of a real-world dataset.
        The results will provide insight into the key drivers of the forecast and help to understand the impact of the features
        on the decisions made by the model.

%\textcolor{red}{ %TODO: Add the following sections
%The submission should cover the following aspects:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item (Identified some, but if it's relevant) The identification of a significant problem in a research field relevant to RuleML+RR 2024.
%    \item (Done) An outline of the current knowledge in the problem’s domain, as well as an overview of existing solutions.
%    \item (Review) A clear formulation of the research question and motivation.
%    \item (Results added not described) A presentation of (possibly preliminary) ideas, the proposed approach, and the results achieved so far.
%    \item (Review)A sketch of the applied research methodology and its positioning in the field.
%    \item (Expected contribution:done)A description of the student’s contribution to the research.
%    \item (TODO:)A discussion of how the suggested solution is different, new, or better as compared to the state of the art.
%    \item (Done)A research plan and the potential achievements.
%\end{itemize}
%}

%The accepted DC papers will be presented to an interested audience and will be discussed with a panel of senior researchers from academia and the industry. Students will present their work through brief oral presentations during a dedicated session of RuleML+RR 2024.
